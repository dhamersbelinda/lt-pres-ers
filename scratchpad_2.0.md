## General notes

We first consider the case where the PO we receive is not an Evidence (?)  
&rarr; we store the hashes and periodically renew their TSs

store hash-trees and timestamps in DB  
At what stage are the Evidence Records created ?
- when do we create the reduced hash-tree ?
- when do we piece together the ATSS ?
  - should the mapper do that ?
- (should additional info be added (EncryptionInformation, SupportingInformation) ? )  
- do we really need to store the POs as previously ?
  - technically (from what i know) all we need is the digests

### Provisional plan : (some parts can be done concurrently)
- implement model classes (Storage structure)
- implement query (retrieval for one POID)
- implement piecing together the query parts
    - including adding info that isn't part of the *main* structure
- map through dto and into API
- implement server calls

### Structure Hierarchy of Evidence Record

<EvidenceRecord Version><!--Section 6-->
  <EncryptionInformation>
     <EncryptionInformationType><!--Students grades are uploaded by months-->
     <EncryptionInformationValue>
  </EncryptionInformation> ?

     <SupportingInformation Type /> +
  </SupportingInformationList> ?
  <ArchiveTimeStampSequence>
     <ArchiveTimeStampChain Order>
        <DigestMethod Algorithm />
        <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm />
        <ArchiveTimeStamp Order>
           <HashTree /> ?
